#### Top tips
- Expert Finder searches for abstracts that mention the topic youâ€™re interested in, then groups the authors, placing the most frequent author of relevant articles at the top of the results.
- We group authors by email address to identify individual authors.  However, some authors may get split into different identities if they publish using more than more email address, and different authors may share the same email address.
